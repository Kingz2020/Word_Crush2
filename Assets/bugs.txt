- bug when both players have the same score, only one player gets points
- when tile is picked up and placed on hand tile the hadtile freezes -> nullrefexception
- placing a tile on the edge, for example [3,15] say, seems to cause a crash.
- placing a tile ona annother tile laid on the board causes a crash.
